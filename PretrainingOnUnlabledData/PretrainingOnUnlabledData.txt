Thus far, we have implemented the data sampling and attention mechanism and
coded the LLM architecture. It is now time to implement a training function and
pretrain the LLM. We will learn about basic model evaluation techniques to measure the quality of the generated text, which is a requirement for optimizing the
LLM during the training process. Moreover, we will discuss how to load pretrained
weights, giving our LLM a solid starting point for fine-tuning. Figure 5.1 lays out
our overall plan, highlighting what we will discuss in this chapter.

We will cover the following:

    -- Computing the training and validation set losses
    to assess the quality of LLM-generated text during training

    --  Implementing a training function and pretraining
    the LLM

    --  Saving and loading model weights to continue
    training an LLM

    -- Loading pretrained weights from OpenAI
